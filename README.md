# point-in-svg-polygon

> Determine if an point is inside a polygon

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rubenv/point-in-svg-polygon.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rubenv/point-in-svg-polygon)

Works with arbitrary polygons (as in: curves!) and is usable in Node.JS as well
as in your browser (through Browserify).

## What it does

Given an SVG path and a point, it'll tell you whether the point lies within the SVG path.

For instance:

![example shapes](example.png)

Color  | Inside red shape (convex)? | Inside blue shape (concave)?
------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------------
Red    | No                         | No
Green  | Yes                        | Yes
Blue   | Yes                        | No
Orange | No                         | Yes

## Usage

Give it a point and a path string:

```js
var pointInSvgPolygon = require("point-in-svg-polygon");

// See the path specification for the correct format
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Paths
var pathString = "M1,1 C1,1 501,1 501,501 C501,1001 1,1001 1,1001 L1,1 Z";
var result = pointInSvgPolygon.isInside([x, y], pathString);
```

You can amortize the path splitting by performing it once:

```js
var pointInSvgPolygon = require("point-in-svg-polygon");

// See the path specification for the correct format
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Paths
var pathString = "M1,1 C1,1 501,1 501,501 C501,1001 1,1001 1,1001 L1,1 Z";
var segments = pointInSvgPolygon.segments(pathString);

// Use it multiple times:
var result = pointInSvgPolygon.isInside([x, y], segments);
```

This is useful if you have to test a lot of points.
